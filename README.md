# Getting Started

## React + Vite Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Two official plugins are available for handling Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This alternative uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Feel free to choose the plugin that best fits your preferences or project requirements.

## Help / Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, consider the following advice for common problems:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Node.js and npm Version:**
   - Ensure you have a compatible version of Node.js installed. This project is designed to work with Node.js version 14.x or later. You can check your Node.js version by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   Update Node.js if needed: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Installation Failures:**
   - If you face issues during the installation of dependencies, try running:
     ```bash
     npm install --legacy-peer-deps
     ```
   This can sometimes resolve compatibility problems with peer dependencies.

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   - If the development server fails to start due to a port conflict, you can specify a different port using:
     ```bash
     npm run dev -- --port <desired-port>
     ```

4. **Community Support:**
   - Reach out to the community on platforms such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for additional support.
